Software testing is the process of checking the quality, functionality, and
performance of a software product before launching. To do software testing,
testers either interact with the software manually or execute test scripts to
find bugs and errors, ensuring that the software works as expected. Software
testing is also done to see if business logic is fulfilled, or if there are any
missing gaps in requirements that need immediate tackles.Â 

Software testing is a crucial part of the software development life cycle.
Without it, app-breaking bugs that can negatively impact the bottom-line may go
undetected. Over time, as applications get more complex, software testing
activities have also evolved, with many new techniques and approaches
introduced.

The manual testing era refers to a time in software development when testing
processes were predominantly conducted manually, without the extensive use of
automated testing tools and frameworks. In the earlier stages of software
development, human testers were responsible for executing test cases, validating
functionalities, and identifying defects by interacting directly with the
software's user interface. This manual approach to testing was time-consuming,
labor-intensive, and prone to human errors, particularly as software systems
became more complex.

1. **Time-Consuming Process**: Manual testing can be a time-consuming process,
  especially when dealing with large and complex software applications. Testers
  need to execute test cases manually, analyze results, and report defects,
  which can slow down the overall development lifecycle.
2. **Human Error**: Manual testing is susceptible to human error, as testers
  might overlook certain scenarios or make mistakes while executing test cases.
  This can lead to inaccurate test results and potentially allow defects to go
  unnoticed, impacting the overall quality of the software.
3. **Limited Test Coverage**: Due to time constraints and the manual nature of
  the testing process, achieving comprehensive test coverage can be challenging.
  Testers may prioritize certain test scenarios or paths, leaving other parts of
  the application untested. This limitation increases the risk of undetected
  defects in the software.
4. **Repetitive Tasks**: Manual testing often involves the repetition of test
  scenarios, especially during regression testing or when new releases are made.
  Performing repetitive tasks can be monotonous and may lead to a decrease in
  the tester's attentiveness, making it more likely for them to miss critical
  defects. Additionally, the repetitiveness can impact the morale and job
  satisfaction of testing teams.

Automated testing is a software testing technique that automates the process of
validating the functionality of software and ensures it meets requirements
before being released into production. With automated testing, an organization
can run specific software tests at a faster pace without human testers.
Automated testing is best suited for large or repetitive test cases.

Automated software testing uses scripted sequences executed by testing tools.
Automated testing tools examine the software, report outcomes and compare
results with earlier test runs. An automated test script can be created once and
then used repeatedly.

  the risk of human error and delivering accurate, reliable results. Tests
  precisely follow predefined steps, minimizing the chance of overlooking
  critical issues.
3. **Cost-effective**: Despite an initial investment in tools and
  infrastructure, automated testing proves cost-effective by reducing the need
  for a large manual testing team. This leads to overall savings in time and
  resources.
4. **Reusability and Scalability**: Automated test scripts are reusable across
  different development phases, providing consistent testing. The scalability of
  automated testing allows efficient testing of larger and more complex systems
  without a proportional increase in manual efforts.

  overall performance of a software application under different conditions. This
  includes stress testing to evaluate system behavior under extreme loads, load
  testing to measure performance under expected user loads, and scalability
  testing to assess the application's ability to handle growing demands.
2. **Load Testing**: Evaluates a system's performance by subjecting it to
  increasing workloads. The goal is to identify the system's capacity limits and
  potential bottlenecks under various levels of user activity.
3. **Acceptance Testing**: Verifies whether the software meets the specified
  requirements and if it is ready for deployment. This type of testing often
  involves automated scripts that simulate end-user interactions to validate the
  application against predefined acceptance criteria.
4. **Security Testing**: Identifies vulnerabilities and weaknesses in the
  software's security measures. Automated security testing tools can scan for
  potential security threats, such as code vulnerabilities, data breaches, or
  unauthorized access, helping to ensure the robustness of the application's
  security features.
