> 2. False

**A**. True

## Problem 4

> What is testing? What are the major activities in the test process?

Testing refers to the process of verifying software requirements as defined by
customers. Depending on the type of the test, it could also validate software
functionality, graphical design, and general correctness. The main test
activities are planning, analysis, implementation, evaluation, and closure.

## Problem 5

> How many test levels are used in V-model? List them with brief explanation.

V-model is a design principle that dictates that there is one test plan for
every corresponding design phase. There are at least 4 design phases followed by
unit testing, integration testing, system testing, and ultimately acceptance
testing. All of them culminate at the center point where coding presumably
happens.

> 2. False

**A**. True

## Problem 12

> What is the main difference between a walkthrough and an inspection?
>
> 1. Authors are not present during inspections, while they are during
     walkthroughs
> 2. A walkthrough is led by the author, while an inspection is led by a trained
     moderator
> 3. An inspection is led by the authors, while walkthrough is led by a trained
     moderator
> 4. An inspection has a trained leader, while a walkthrough has no leader

**B**. A walkthrough is led by the author, while an inspection is led by a
trained moderator

## Problem 17

> What is required to create a Test Plan? "IEEE 829 Standard Test Plan Template"

To create a test plan, IEE 829 recommends several components in the
documentation such as background, objectives, and milestones. The template also
included a timeline of each deliverable, the approach taken, and the working
staff responsible for the test.

## Problem 18

> What is the difference between functional and non-functional testing? Provide
  the examples.

Functional testing is a common test procedure that checks a software's overall
usability during standard circumstances. In contrast, non-functional testing has
targeted goals, specific parameters to uphold, and controlled testing
environment. For example, in a university system, a functional test is just a
student logging into the system, while a non-functional test would measure the
system's performance and uptime.

## Problem 19

> What is white-box and what is black-box testing? When and who does white-box
  testing?

White-box testing is a term used to denote a test performed by internal testers
with some expertise in the software they are testing. With some knowledge of the
software, white-box testers are able to throw more into the test and extract
extensive information. Whereas there is no requirement when conducting black-box
testing. They are instead focused on the most visible components like
functionality and usability.

## Problem 20

> The ISTQB Foundation Syllabus establishes a fundamental test process where
  test planning occurs early in the project, while test execution occurs later.
  Which of the following elements of the test plan, while specified during test
  planning, are assessed during test execution?
>
> 1. Exit criteria
> 2. Test team training
> 3. Test tasks
> 4. Environmental needs

**A**. Exit criteria
